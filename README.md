#### What is Bitcoin?

Forget about the "coin" in Bitcoin for a moment. Bitcoin is a worldwide database with records that cannot be changed. New records can be added, but it is impossible to alter old records. Anyone can run software on any computer or smartphone and access this database, to read any records that have ever been written to the database.

Because it is not possible to mutate these database records, it's only practical that the first application of Bitcoin is currency. The database record history, or **blockchain**, holds records telling who owns what. Charlie owns 3 Bitcoin. Sara owns 0.5 Bitcoin. George owns 0.0003 Bitcoin.
