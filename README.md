# What is Bitcoin?

Forget about the "coin" in Bitcoin for a moment. Bitcoin is a worldwide database with records that cannot be changed. New records can be added, but it is impossible to alter old records. Anyone can run software on any computer or smartphone and access this database, to read any records that have ever been written to the database.

Because it is not possible to mutate these database records, it's only natural that the first application of Bitcoin is currency. The database history, or **blockchain**, holds records telling who owns what. Charlie owns 3 Bitcoin. Sara owns 0.5 Bitcoin. George owns 0.0003 Bitcoin.

## Who owns Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is not a company; Bitcoin is a protocol. You may have heard of TCP/IP, a computer protocol which powers much of the internet. Just like TCP/IP, Bitcoin the protocol is not owned by anyone, it is simply a tool which anyone can use to securely prove ownership of resources.


## What is Bitcoin mining?

Bitcoin mining is a process which prevents users from cheating the ledger. Miners use the ledger of all past transactions, and ensure that spenders are rightful owners of the funds that they claim to be spending. This process is done using software on high performance computers, and mining is what makes the Bitcoin network so secure. Because of the mining process, Charlie can't spend 5 Bitcoin when he only owns 3.


## What is Bitcoin backed by? ** @todo maybe not helpful for beginners? **

Definitely not authority. Bitcoin is backed by Math, and Energy. (Try corrupting those!)


## How many Bitcoin are there? **@todo probably too much detail here**

As of May 2017, there are around 16 million Bitcoin in circulation. Like dollars once had, Bitcoin has a sort of "gold standard" in that only 21 million Bitcoin can ever exist. Not to worry, Bitcoin is infinitely divisible which means that as the value of Bitcoin rises, users can conveniently switch denominations from millibits, to microbits. The mining process creates new Bitcoin as a reward for miners, but after 21 million have been mined, miners can still generate revenue from transaction fees.


## What do I need to participate?

Anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network. Unlike traditional money, with Bitcoin you don't need to ask permission or rely on a central authority.

The easiest way to get started with Bitcoin is to install "Bitcoin wallet" software on your smartphone. Using a popular Bitcoin wallet such as Mycelium, you can send and receive Bitcoin.


## How is Bitcoin used?

Bitcoin's most popular use is as digital cash for the internet. Using Bitcoin, Sara can pay Charlie directly for goods or services, in the same way as when she pays in-person using physical cash. Bitcoin liberates users from the fees, political censorship, middlemen, and gatekeepers which are inherent in payment methods such as VISA, MASTERCARD, and Paypal.


## Is Bitcoin anonymous?

Bitcoin is not anonymous, because it's blockchain or ledger is public record. Anybody can use a website such as Blockchain.info to look up every transaction any given Bitcoin address has participated in. Bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning there is by default no ties between identity and transaction. Any curious individual could potentially figure out your buying and selling history, unless you took steps to remain anonymous, such as using a new Bitcoin address for every transaction.


## How do I use Bitcoin?

When Charlie sends 1 Bitcoin to George, the Bitcoin isn't actually going anywhere. All that is happening is that the global Bitcoin ledger (blockchain) is being updated to show that George now owns 1 more Bitcoin, and Charlie owns 1 less Bitcoin. Charlie is able to spend the Bitcoin in his account because Charlie owns the **private key** which unlocks the Bitcoin he owns. In Bitcoin, private keys equal ownership. Without that private key, Charlie can't spend the Bitcoin in his account.

Using a Bitcoin wallet app such as Mycelium, you can generate a public Bitcoin address, along with a private key to spend the Bitcoin at said address.

## Hot wallets

Having a Bitcoin wallet on your phone is often called a "hot wallet," meaning it's not the most secure way of storing Bitcoin. You could potentially lose your phone, along with your private keys, which means you wouldn't be able to spend your Bitcoin anymore.

Because of the nature of hot wallets, it is important to create a backup of your private keys in case your device is lost or stolen. This feature is available in all quality Bitcoin wallets. Remember, your wallet doesn't hold the Bitcoin, it only holds the keys which allow you to spend your Bitcoin. As long as you have your private keys, you can recover your ability to spend your Bitcoin even if your device is lost.


## Maximum Security Cold Storage

The most secure way to hold Bitcoin is either a hardware wallet, or cold storage paper wallet. A hardware wallet is a device manufactured for the sole purpose of securely sending and receiving Bitcoin. Many have multiple layers of authentication such as a PIN plus a fingerprint.

A cold storage paper wallet is a low-tech way to securely store Bitcoin. It is simply a piece of paper containing both public and private keys belonging to a Bitcoin address. Think of it like a piggy bank-- you can send Bitcoin to your paper wallet over time using your hot wallet, then when you need to retrieve the Bitcoin, you "break it open" using hot wallet software such as Mycelium, after which you destroy the paper.


## Future of Blockchain

Since Bitcoin is just a database with unalterable records, other uses for Bitcoin are being developed. Bitcoin can be a highly redundant way to store ownership records for assets such as land, rental cars, digital goods, and more. With Blockchain technology, the limits are virtualy endless!


## The cons of Bitcoin

Bitcoin is going through an awkward phase right now. There are definate growing pains associated with it's governance model being a "Hashogracy", where whichever miners have majority computing power set the rules for the network. Many miners are holding back on upgrading to new mining software with features that help Bitcoin scale to widespread use, because their profits would lessen. Because of this resistance, transaction times in Bitcoin are slow on occasion, and transaction fees are on the rise.

## Altcoins

Competition is healthy, and alternatives to Bitcoin are cropping up almost every day. In terms of market capital, Ethereum comes in number 2 with ~$17 Billion. Ethereum offers more features such as programmable smart contracts, where you can send money only when certain conditions are satisfied. DASH is another good alt coin, offering a private ledger for anonymous transactions as well as a voting system for deciding on network-wide changes. The list goes on and on, with intended special use cases varying from humourous Dogecoin, to ultra-fast Litecoin, to dank PotCoin. There is a coin for everyone!
